## Country fetching APIs 

We used country.is API for retrieving country of websites domain. 
"Country is a free IP-to-country geolocation API that returns a userâ€™s country based on their IP address"
When re-running the notebook make sure that the countries are well returned by the API (if the country returned is "None" please try again or with an another API).
